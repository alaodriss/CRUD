CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. It is a set of four basic functions that are commonly used when working with databases or other types of data storage systems.

Create: This operation is used to create new data records in the system. It involves adding new data to the database, which could be a new row in a table, a new document in a document store, or a new object in an object-oriented database.

Read: This operation is used to retrieve data from the database. It involves querying the database to retrieve specific data records, which could be a single row or multiple rows of a table, a document from a document store, or an object from an object-oriented database.

Update: This operation is used to modify existing data records in the database. It involves changing the values of one or more fields in a data record.

Delete: This operation is used to remove data records from the database. It involves deleting one or more rows from a table, removing a document from a document store, or deleting an object from an object-oriented database.

These four basic operations form the basis of most database interactions and are often used in software applications to manage data.
